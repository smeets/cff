# 2 - obfuscation

Obfuscation is often regarded as a subpar solution to a difficult problem. While its reputation isn't necessarily undue it is important to recognise that obfuscation is a means to an end, whatever that is, with both poor and solid implementations.

As with security, obfuscation is outrageously hard to get right and simple mistakes and oversights can be devastating. Once the product is shipped, that's it - it's out there for the world to see and (ab)use.

Track record of obfuscation techniques?
